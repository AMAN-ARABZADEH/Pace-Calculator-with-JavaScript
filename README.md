# Pace-Calculator-with-JavaScript
I have created a Pace Calculator website that can help runners calculate their average pace based on the distance and time of their run. As a fellow runner, I understand the importance of setting goals and tracking progress in order to improve performance. This tool can help runners stay motivated and focused on their training.

The website is user-friendly and easy to navigate. Simply enter the distance and time of your run, and the calculator will automatically calculate your average pace in minutes per mile or kilometres. You can also use the website to convert your pace to different units of measurement.

I hope that runners of all levels find this Pace Calculator useful in their training. By tracking your pace and progress, you can set realistic goals and work towards becoming a better and faster runner.
